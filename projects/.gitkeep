# Projects Directory

This directory contains all solution projects managed by the agentic framework.

Each project should have:
- `.project-context.md` - Project context and status
- Standard structure (src/, infrastructure/, docs/, backlog/)
- Project-specific configurations

See `templates/project-template/` for scaffolding new projects.
